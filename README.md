CTFs often have the default Ubuntu Apache webpage being served with a hint in a comment on the page
This script will diff that page with the default page in this repo

I saw something similar used in a CTF writeup somewhere and thought it seemed like a good idea

Work still to do:
Add some error checks to pick up things like forgetting to add a URL to check
